# MelodyHub

Welcome to **MelodyHub**, your ultimate destination for discovering and sharing your favorite music. This project is designed to provide a seamless and engaging experience for music enthusiasts.

## Description

**MelodyHub** is a music social media web application that allows users to search for songs, listen to them alongside lyrics, and post their ratings to their profiles. We utilized the **Spotify Web API** and **Genius API** for accessing a vast library of music and lyrics. To secure user accounts, **JWT authentication** was implemented.

   Click on the search bar to browse through Spotify’s library of songs.

   On the review page, you can listen to the song and read its lyrics to help formulate your opinion. When ready, select the number of stars you rate the song, leave a comment, and click "Submit." Your review will now appear on your home screen.

   Continue using **MelodyHub** to catalog your favorite (and perhaps not-so-favorite) songs!
